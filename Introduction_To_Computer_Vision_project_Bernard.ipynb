        "The supermarket chain would like to explore whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage. You are asked to conduct that evaluation, so as you set to work, keep the following in mind:\n",

        "● The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol.\n",
        "\n",
        "● Computer vision methods can be used to determine the age of a person from a photo.\n",

        "● The task then is to build and evaluate a model for verifying people's age.\n",

        "● Combine your code, output, and findings (from the previous points) in the final notebook.\n",
